# Intrusion-Detection-in-IoT-network-using-Deep-Learning-Algorithms

Significant increase application of IOT that have become integral part of our daily live. This exponential growth of IOT networks has made it more and more difficult to deal with hostile activity they may be subject to. Many approaches have been proposed to address the various security concerns facing IoT, but more effort still have to be done. Amongst those proposed solutions, Machine Learning has emerged as an approach to deal with hostile activities in IoT. In this study, we use deep learning to identify flow-based anomalies in an IoT setting. For an intrusion detection system, we create severals Neural Network models and evaluated them using standard Dataset for evaluation. The goal was classify normal and abnormal flow traffics. Our results showed that machine learnings algorithms could be very efficient for intrusion detection. We obtained an accuracy score of 95% for the DNN and LSTM model respectively and an accuracy of 94% for the MLP and CNN. Furthermore with the ROC curve, we achieved a detection rate above 99% for all our models
